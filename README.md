# Calculator-App

## Description 

This project was created using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

The aim of this project was to learn further Dom manipulation through javascript and understanding
scopes and arrays.

Some of the challenges I faced while working on this project was trying to figure 
out how print and store a value when a user presses on a button. I found that 
challenging because I was mixing up local and global variables and forgetting to 
return statements at times

I also understand array manipulation better and I found it interesting to use array's in this 
project
